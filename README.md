####General Assembly WDI February 23, 2015 Project 2

#####Overview:

memori is a web application that allows parents to create an online baby journal of important memories via daily text messages. memori sends a single text message containing a single question each day. Parents can respond by text, and the site will log their responses. Parents can update their answers at any time, resulting in a full record of memories that might otherwise go unrecorded.

memori was developed as a project for the January 2015 General Assembly Web Development Immersive course, over a week-long sprint to gain experience with authentication/authroziation, ActiveRecord relations, APIs, and CRUD applications.
